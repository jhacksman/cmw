# Signal Chat with Dean Pierce (px)

This document contains conversation excerpts from Signal chat with Dean Pierce (px), the owner of the crackmywallet.org wallet. These insights are critical for understanding his password/passphrase habits.

## Conversation Log

### On Passphrase Format (Spaces vs No Spaces)

**Q:** Which would you say feels more natural "This is a very bad password" or "Thisisaverybadpassword"?

**px:** Spaces. Maybe periods.

---

### On Leetspeak Patterns

**Q:** I've exhausted a few scripts, 100 billion permutations or so. I'm wondering how you would leetify 'this is a very bad password'. Also wondering how many chars you would put at the end typically, like 123, or !@#, wondering what's common specifically for you based on other known passwords and your tendencies. 111!11!...

**px:** Likely 1, 3, maybe 6, exclamations or question marks sometimes tildes or back ticks, I've leetified pass as p455, p@$$, and combinations like that

---

### On Using 7 as R in Leetspeak

**Q:** Ever do 7 as a stand in for r, in leetspeak? Like p455ph7453

**px:** I've done |2 maybe but never 7 I'm pretty sure.

**px:** @ for a and $ for s sometimes as well, I don't think I've ever had a password with a pipe in it

**px:** I think maybe I've written R as |2, but not 7

### On Game of Thrones References

**Q:** Ever use any game of thrones inspired passwords? 2011 it was brand new on HBO.

**px:** Nah, I think it was much later when I actually started watching it, like season 4

**Funny story..** back in the long long ago, I kept a wallet on one of my toy dev laptops that I would use to test out different fun Bitcoin related websites I was building. I regularly sent small numbers of coins (you know, like 2-3 btc) to and from the wallet, so it was probabally some derpy password, but at some point I forgot it. I figured I'd stash the wallet away and it would be a fun piggybank for me to crack later. Well, I've spent the past few months grinding on it with the GPUs in my garage without much luck, so I thought it'd be fun to open it up to the community. I'll probabally update the site at some point with motivational screenshots of the wallet, and a list of things tried so far. There's a little over 25 btc in the wallet, and I'm happy to share 5 of them with anyone who can help unlock it. Good luck!

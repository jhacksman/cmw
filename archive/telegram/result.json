Even if it's pretty long, but you have some information to narrow down the search space, you've got a good shot.\nThe general algorithm for calculating how many bits of entropy is in you search space is log2(alphabet_size ^ length). If it's over 100, you're basically fucked. Heat death of the universe etc. If it's closer to like, 50, then yeah maybe it can be done with hobbyist equipment.\nNSA sponsored mountains full of cracking rigs will get you into the 70-80 bit search space, maybe."
